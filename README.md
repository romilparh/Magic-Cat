# Magic-Cat

It is basic Android implementation of Magic Cat Academy which is a browser game created as a Google Doodle. There are three type of enemies which are killed by either left/right/vertical swipe. Winning is totally based on the score a person scores. There is a lifeline that comes randomly after interval and has to reach the player cat itself. The player keeps on playing until he/she dies. The enemies respawn randomly at random location with a random kill condition. 

It also has "Background Sound Effects" which can be turned ON/OFF by the player itself, either at the beginning or anytime during the play.
